# Parallelization-of-algorithms-and-performance-analysis

Developed parallelized versions of various well-known algorithms and analyzed performance parameters as part of assignments in CS F422 (Parallel Computing) at BITS Pilani. 
This repository includes the following parallel programs along with their analysis:
- Parallel version of Sollin's minimal spanning tree algorithm using MPI
- Implementation of HyperQuickSort using OpenMP
- Blelloch's scan (parallel prefix sum) using CUDA
